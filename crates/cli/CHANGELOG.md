# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Wire the effective-config oracle into the scan path and keep post-scan confidence filtering on the same resolved floor as the scanner.
- Update stale unit fixtures for the inline-byte credential-hash contract and removed duplicate startup-summary helper.
- Keep default `--git-diff HEAD` wired to worktree changes, honor CLI excludes for staged-only scans, and refresh git-mode e2e contracts for clean staged inputs and SARIF schema coherence.

## 0.2.1

- Align package metadata with the Santh Standard.
- Keep CLI orchestration, output modes, baseline filtering, and detector discovery behavior available for the 0.2 line.
