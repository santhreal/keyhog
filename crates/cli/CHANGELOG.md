# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Split contiguous filesystem batches at safe source-family and size-provenance
  boundaries, extend the split to tracked and untracked git-diff inputs, and
  calibrate every default fused count for extracted tar members. Empty stdin is
  no longer reported as a calibrated workload. Current installers delegate this
  core sweep to the binary instead of maintaining a second matrix.
- Rename the live GPU region-presence batch byte budget to
  `--gpu-batch-input-limit` / `gpu_batch_input_limit`; accept the retired
  MegaScan spelling as a hidden CLI/TOML migration alias.
- Include full-source-size provenance in autoroute workload keys so streamed or
  transformed payload sizes cannot silently reuse calibration measured from an
  equal numeric full-file-size bucket.
- Activate the CLI `simd` feature in default builds so the documented
  Hyperscan `--cache-dir` surface works whenever the default scanner includes
  Hyperscan instead of falsely reporting an accelerator-free binary.
- Stop prewarming an automatic backend from a zero-byte heuristic before the
  persisted workload-specific autoroute decision is known; explicit diagnostic
  backend overrides still prewarm directly.
- Report the configured backend policy at startup instead of claiming that a
  backend was selected before the persisted per-workload decision exists.
- Do not print end-of-run repeat summaries for dependency warnings hidden by
  the default log filter; summaries now describe only visible KeyHog warnings.
- Record the actual first GPU dispatch as autoroute cold-start evidence instead
  of discarding it and mislabelling an already-warm second dispatch as cold.
- Distinguish one-shot and persistent-daemon autorouting: one-shot scans include
  GPU cold cost, while the daemon initializes accelerator state before serving
  requests and selects from calibrated warm timing evidence.
- Replace autoroute cache writes through a synced same-directory temporary file
  so recalibration atomically replaces an existing cache path across supported
  operating systems.
- Route CLI report/cache writes through one atomic file replacement helper,
  including `scan-system --output`, to avoid truncated final-path artifacts.
- Refuse autoroute calibration on empty or zero-byte samples before timing so
  calibration cannot persist route decisions that the cache loader would later
  reject as missing sample evidence.
- Add `keyhog config --effective` and keep post-scan confidence filtering on the same resolved floor as the scanner.
- Update stale unit fixtures for the inline-byte credential-hash contract and removed duplicate startup-summary helper.
- Keep default `--git-diff HEAD` wired to worktree changes, honor CLI excludes for staged-only scans, and refresh git-mode e2e contracts for clean staged inputs and SARIF schema coherence.
- Move args, hook, and scan-system inline tests into registered aggregate unit modules, including scan-system redaction tests updated for the raw `[u8; 32]` hash contract.
- Refresh the dogfood detector-count oracle to 894 and keep the structured UUID named-detector default-recall e2e passing.
- Distinguish detector-TOML declarations from scan-time fallback policy in
  `keyhog explain`, using the same `scan-fallback` provenance label as effective
  configuration output.

## 0.2.1

- Align package metadata with the Santh Standard.
- Keep CLI orchestration, output modes, baseline filtering, and detector discovery behavior available for the 0.2 line.
